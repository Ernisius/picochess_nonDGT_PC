This folder is for startup files to let picochess start automatically. These files are the new versions you should use
from jessie system onwards. Please copy *.service & *.target files to the "/etc/systemd/system" folder. The dgtpi* files
you only need if you have a DgtPi chess computer.


If you have problems please don't hassitate to contact me over eMail or skype.
