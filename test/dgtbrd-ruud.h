Main functionality of the DGT Electronic Chess Board
----------------------------------------------------

The DGT board is basically a sensor which senses the presense of the special
chess set pieces on the squares of the board. The situation on the board is 
measured and can be communicated with an average maximum time delay of
200 mS.
Besides this detection function, the board communicates with an optional 
DGT TopMatch or XL Chess Clock, to give the data of the clock available to 
the general interface. 
Finally the board is equipped with an internal storage of the measured
piece positions.

The board supports two methods of communication: for single-board situations
a protocol for communication between one board and one computer is available.

For situations with many boards a network communications protocol is 
available, where many boards can be connected in a bus structure. A separate
communication protocol is available for this bus structure.

The communication protocol for single board connections is described
in the following paragraph "Single board communication protocol". This 
paragraph describes much more than only the communication protocol. All 
developers should read this paragraph, even if they would only use bus
communication.

The special bus communication protocol is derived from the single board
communication and functionality, where the main added feature is the 
possibility to address a specific board on a shared communication bus. 
The commands and data contens are described in the paragraph "Bus  
Communication Protocol", Note however that the contens can not be understood 
without reading the single board communication paragraph. 


Paragraph: Single board communication protocol
----------------------------------------------

The main function of the board is to transfer piece position information. 
For this, three modes are available:
1. IDLE mode. This cancelles any of the UPDATE modes. No automatic 
transfer of moves.
2. UPDATE_BOARD mode. On the moment that the board detects a removal, change
or placing of a piece, it outputs a DGT_SEND_UPDATE message
3. UPDATE mode. As UPDATE_BOARD mode, where additional the clock data are send
regularly (at least every second)
4. UPDATE_NICE mode. As UPDATE mode, but clock data is only sent when it has
changed.

The board accepts command codes from the computer RS232. The commands are
1-byte codes, sometimes followed by data (see code definition)
The board can send data to the computer. Data always carries a message header.
The message header contains a message code and the total message size in bytes.
The start of the incoming message can be recognised by the MSB of the message
identifier set to 1 (see definition).

Board to computer communication interfaces:
RS232 for communication with computer, receiving commands, sending data
- 9600 Baud, 1 stopbit, 1 startbit, no parity
- No use of handshaking, neither software nor hardware

Connection between Digital Game Timer TopMatch Clock and the board:
Based on NEC SBI protocol. Adaption of the definition given in
the DGT TopMatch documentation.

Connector assignments for DGT Electronic Board: See User
and Programmers Manual

Related to the before mentioned modes, and to piece position information
transfer, the following commands to the board are available:
1. DGT_SEND_RESET 
puts the DGT Board in IDLE mode 
2. DGT_SEND_CLK
on which the DGT board responds with a DGT_MSG_BWTIME message containing 
clock information
3. DGT_SEND_BRD
on which the DGT Board responds with a DGT_MSG_BOARD_DUMP message containing
the actual piece exising of all fields
4. DGT_SEND_UPDATE puts the DGT Board in the UPDATE mode, FRITZ5 compatible
5. DGT_SEND_UPDATE_BRD puts the DGT Board in the UPDATE_BOARD mode
6. DGT_SEND_UPDATE_NICE puts the board in UPDATE mode, however transferring
   only clocktimes when any time info changed.

The DGT_SEND_CLK command and the DGT_SEND_BOARD command do not affect the 
current board mode: i.e. when in UPDATE mode, it continues sending 
DGT_SEND_UPDATE messages.

Board Identification:
Each DGT Electronic Board carries a unique serial number, 
a EEPROM configuration version number and a embedded program version number.
These data are unalterable by the users.
An identification looks like:

"DGT Projects - This DGT board is produced by DGT Projects.\n
 DGT Projects is a registered trade mark.\n
 220798 ISP/bus/8KP/8KE/P6/Fritz5 Vs 1.00. Serial nr. 00137 1.0"

The board can be loaded by the user with a non-volatile one-byte bus number, 
for future use with multiple board configurations.

On-board EEPROM:
The board carries a 8 kB cyclic non-volatile memory, in which all position
changes and clock information is stored during all power-up time. This
file can be read and processed.

/* 
Description of the EEPROM data storage and dump format
------------------------------------------------------

General: The internal EEPROM storage can be seen as a cyclic buffer with length
0x1f00 bytes, with one pointer, pointing to the last written byte in the buffer.
Only at this pointer location, data can be written, incrementing the pointer.
The written data always overwrites the oldest data. 
In this buffer, sequentially messages are written. The messages are of various
length, from 1 byte to 5 bytes, specific for every message. 
Various events generate a message that is written in the storage, in the 
sequence as the events occur. When the buffer is downloaded and read, the event
messages can be found, starting with the oldest event, and the latest event in
the end of the buffer, followed by EE_EOF.

- At power-on, three tags EE_NOP are written, followed by a one-byte 
EE_POWERUP message. 
After this, an UPDATE_BOARD message is written (in virtually random sequence)
for every piece that is found on the board, at power-on.
When the board is equipped with a watchdog timer, and the watchdog times out,
an EE_WATCHDOG_ACTION is written and after that, the above described power-up 
procedure takes place.

- When at any time a normal starting position for chess is found, with the 
player for white having the board connector on his left hand, an EE_BEGINPOS tag
is written, and an EE_BEGINPOS_ROT tag is written when white has the
connector at his right hand (rotated)

- 8x8 board: When 16 chess figures are found on the board, all in the A, B, G 
and H row, which are not(!) in a normal chess starting position, the one-byte
EE_FOURROWS message is written, to be tolerant on erroneous placement and i.e.  
to be able to play the "Random Chess" as proposed by Bobby
Fischer. The exact position of the pieces has to be analyzed on the context: 
or found in the previous piece move messages, or found in the
coming piece move messages.

- For 10x10 boards, EE_FOURROWS indicates a position of which the center TWO
rows are empty and all other fields are occupied.

When an empty board is detected, the one-byte EE_EMPTYBOARD message is
written.

The above described detection of begin positions or empty-board has a certain
hysteresis: only after more than two pieces have been out of the begin 
positions the search for begin positions is restarted, resulting in possibly
new tag writing. This to avoid flushing the buffer full with data, only because
of one bad positioned and flashing piece.

When the data of the internal storage are sent upon reception of the
DGT_SEND_EE_MOVES command, the one-byte EE_DOWNLOADED message is sent

On every detected change of piece positions this change is written to EEPROM
in a 2-byte message, which cover exactly the same data as is sent to the PC
in the UPDATE_BOARD mode.
The formatting of the 2-byte piece update tag is:
First byte:     0t0r nnnn (n is piece code, see before)
			  (piece code EMPTY when a piece is removed)
			  (t is recognition bit, always 1)
			  (r is '1' when the time since the previous update 
			   tag was written is less than approx. 250 ms, 
			   otherwise '0')
		so the first byte of this tag is always in the 
		range 0x40 to 0x5f
Second byte:    00ii iiii (i = 0 to 63 (0x3f), the field number as
			   defined before)

NB: when one piece only is changing, the new value is overwrites the 
piece update field described above, instead of generating a new message
in the internal storage. 
The same kind of optimization is included for begin-position tags:
a EE_BEGINPOS or EE_BEGINPOS_ROT or EE_FOURROWS is not written, when 
between the previous written tags and the new occurence of the begin-
situation only 2 or 1 piece were out of the tagged beginsituation.

On the pressing of the clock, the time of the halted clock is written in
a time message. It might be that when the moves are done very fast, the
storage is skipped. Note: the two clock sides are identified only by
left and right side of the clock: When the board is swapped, the clock
data are not (!) swapped.

The clock data are written on tumbler position change, so at the beginning
of the game, the game starting times will be lost.

Format of a three-byte time message:
First byte:    0uuf hhhh (f=1 for time in left clock screen, seen from
			  the front)
			 ( hhhh: hours, valued 0 to 9)
			 (uu recognition bits, both 1, so byte 0 has the
			 ( value range of 0x60 to 0x69, or 0x70 to 0x79)
Second byte:   0MMM mmmm (MMM: Tens of minutes (range 0 to 5),
			 (mmmm: minute units, range 0 to 9)

Third byte:    0SSS ssss (SSS: tens of seconds, range 0-5)
			 (ssss: seconds units, range 0-9)

On the recognition of the first byte of a message: The above definitions
imply that the first byte of a message is always ranged
from 40-5f for a field change message, 60-69 or 70-79 for a time message,
and 6a to 6f, or 7a to 7f for a 1-byte message. 
(all values hexadecimal)

/*
Notes on the communication dynamics:
The squares of the board are sampled one by one, where a full scan takes
about 200-250 ms. Due to this scan time, it can be, that a piece that is
moved from square e.g. A2 to A3 can be seen on both squares, in the same
scan. On a next scan of course, the old position is not seen anymore.
When in UPDATE mode, this means, that the information on changes on the
squares can come in opposite sequence: first the new occurence is reported,
then the clearing of the old position is sent.
When a piece B on C4 is taken by piece A on B3, it can be that the following
changes are reported:
A on C4
Empty on B3
(and Empty on C4 is never seen)
An other extreme situation can occur e.g. when a queen on C1 takes a pawn
on C4. The reported changes can be (in sequence):
Empty on C4 (the pawn is taken by one hand)
Queen on C2
Queen on C3
Empty on C1
Empty on C2
Queen on C4
Empty on C3
For writing software it is important to take these dynamics into account.
Some effort needs to be made to reconstruct the actual moves of the pieces.

Paragraph: Bus communication protocol
-------------------------------------

Differencens between busmode and single board mode:
* In bus mode, RS232 input and RS232 output are connected to all boards.
The RS232 output of the board is configured as a pull-up driver: with a 
pull-down resistor on the RS232 pull-up line. Now all boards receive all 
commands from the computer, and can all send data to the computer.
* In single board mode the board has a small incoming commands
buffer (10 bytes).
* The bus mode has only a one-command incoming commands buffer
* When entered in single board mode, the board status always switches to IDLE:
changes are not send automatically

Bus mode is default power up mode of the board. The board recognises
bus commands from the start.
However, single board commands are recognised and answered.
The board switches to single board mode on the moment, a single board
command is recognised. Switching back to bus mode is invoked by the 
extra command DGT_TO_BUSMODE or by sending a busmode command. (NB This 
busmode command causing the swithing is not processed!)

For all detailed hardware descriptions: call.

	I.e. message code 0x81 0x10 0x06 will carry checksum byte 0x17

DGT_BUS_SEND_CLK
asks for clock information of addressed board.
Will result in a DGT_MSG_BUS_BWTIME message from the board.

DGT_BUS_SEND_BRD
asks for a board dump of addressed board.
Will result in a DGT_MSG_BUS_BRD_DUMP message from the board.

DGT_BUS_SEND_CHANGES
asks for all stored information changes from the moment of the last
DGT_BUS_SEND_CHANGES. Will result in a DGT_MSG_BUS_UPDATE message from 
the board.
In case these data do not arrive properly, the data can be asked again
with the DGT_BUS_REPEAT_CHANGES command.

DGT_BUS_REPEAT_CHANGES
Causes the board to send last sent packet of changes again.

DGT_BUS_SET_START_GAME
sets an EE_START_TAG tag in the internal board changes buffer, for use in the
following command DGT_BUS_SEND_FROM_START. After this EE_START_TAG the 
positions of the pieces are all logged in the file.
The command is answered with a DGT_MSG_BUS_START_GAME_WRITTEN message,
about 70 msec. after receipt of DGT_BUS_SET_START_GAME

DGT_BUS_SEND_FROM_START
causes the board to send a DGT_MSG_BUS_FROM_START message, containing
all update information starting with EE_START_TAG until the last registered
changes (excluding the moves that are to be sent with the DGT_BUS_SEND_CHANGES
command). Remember that after the EE_START_TAG all piece positions are written
in the eeprom file.

DGT_BUS_PING
causes the addressed board to send a DGT_MSG_BUS_PING message.
NB: when the DGT_BUS_PING command is sent with board address 0 (zero )
all connected boards will reply with a DGT_MSG_BUS_PING message, randomly
spread over a 1100 msec. interval. This to avoid collision. For reliable
identification of all connected boards, this process should be repeated
sometimes with checking of checksums!

DGT_IGNORE_NEXT_BUS_PING
is used in the process of detecting connected boards on a bus. After this 
command (which itself sends a DGT_MSG_BUS_PING as handshake) the first
following DGT_BUS_PING with address zero (!) is ignored. This command
can be used to suppress response of already detected boards, and decreases
the chance of bus collisions.
This command responds immediately with a DGT_MSG_BUS_PING.

DGT_BUS_END_BUSMODE
causes the board to quit busmode, and go into single-connection mode.
Be careful not to use this command in a multiple board configuration!
NOTE: Any single-board command arriving during bus mode will 
switch a board to single-board mode and will be processed. When sent
with address 0 the command is processed on all connected boards

DGT_BUS_RESET
forces a power-up reset procedure. NB: this procedure takes some seconds.
When sent with address 0 the command is processed on all conected boards

DEFINITION OF THE MESSAGE DATA FORMATS FROM BOARD TO PC
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General: the message format is:
byte 1: message type byte (MSB = 1)
byte 2: message length MSB (from byte 1 to checksum) (D7=0)
byte 3: message length LSB (containing D0 to D6 of the length (D7 = 0)
byte 4: board address MSB (D7=0)
byte 5: board address LSB (D7=0)
< data bytes: 0 to theoretically 16K-6 bytes >
last byte: checksum. This is the sum of all byte values from byte 1 to
	   the byte before this checksum. D7 is forced to 0

DGT_MSG_BUS_BRD_DUMP
the data area contains the piece codes from field 1 to field 64, in format
identical as the single board command

DGT_MSG_BUS_BWTIME
the data area contains the clock time information, in format identical as
the single board command

DGT_MSG_BUS_UPDATE
the data area contains a variable amount of change information, formatted
as described in the DGT_DUMP_EEMOVES message

DGT_MSG_BUS_FROM_START
the data area contains a variable amount of change information, formatted
as described in the DGT_DUMP_EEMOVES message

DGT_MSG_BUS_PING
the data area is empty: a message of 6 bytes is returned.

DGT_MSG_BUS_START_GAME_WRITTEN
The same format as for DGT_MSG_BUS_PING

DGT_MSG_BUS_VERSION
The two data bytes contain binary version number: first byte main number
second byte sub number.

Tips for usage of the bus mode:

A. On connection of power and starting of the communication process:
- Check communication with addressed DGT_BUS_PING commands to all expected
  boards.
LOOP:
- Send DGT_BUS_IGNORE_NEXT_PING to all found boards
- Check eventually extra boards or unknown board busnumbers by using
  a DGT_BUS_PING with address zero.
- Register the found boards, and go to LOOP:, until no more boards are found


B. At the start of an event: when all boards have pieces in starting
 position, send DGT_BUS_SET_START_GAME commands to all boards.
- Read full clock times from all boards.

C. During a game: send DGT_BUS_SEND_CHANGES to all boards sequentially,
 once every few seconds. The returned data should logically match
 with the expected piece positions. When any mismatch occurs: ask full
 position with DGT_BUS_SEND_BRD.

D. When previous data are lost: send a DGT_BUS_SEND_FROM_START command
 which returns the full registered changes from the starting position.

On every sent message: The responce time at the board is within milliseconds
normally, except when the board is storing a measured change in the
internal EEPROM: Then the responce time can be up to 20 milliseconds.
So allow a time-out on sent messages of say 80 mS.

Checksum errors: when a received checksum does not match, resend the command
except on the DGT_BUS_SEND_CHANGES: then the command DGT_BUS_REPEAT_CHANGES
should be used, to avoid discarding of the changes sent by the board.

On clock data:
- reading data out of the clock and make them available
  for communication causes a delay of up to 1 second between clock display
  and received data.
