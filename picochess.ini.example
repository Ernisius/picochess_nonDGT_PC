### ===================================
### Example and description how to configure PicoChess
### To use this file, simply copy this file to picochess.ini and edit the appropriate settings
### When you want to activate a flag/line, please remove the "# " infront of it f.e. "# book = ..." becomes "book = ..."
### Its important you keep this file valid (like here, no leading spaces), otherwise picochess won't work correctly.

### From v0.71 on some picochess.ini values are overridden when you change their values using the menu system
### Perhaps its a good idea to keep a copy of "picochess.ini" before you are going live with your picochess ;-)
### The section "DGT", "remote-engine", "Mail", and some "Picochess" flags are examples which can only be changed here

### Lines that start with 3x# are general comments
### Lines that start with 2x# explain the option of the next line that starts with one # 
### Lines that start with 1x# are option lines, delete the # to use the option

### =======================
### = DGT related options =
### =======================
## disable-revelation-leds turns OFF the leds on the Revelation II board. If so, please uncomment the next line
# disable-revelation-leds = True
## beep-some-level changes the occurrence of beeps. Minimum value is 0 (no beeps), maximum is 15 (all beeps).
## Please keep in mind: values 0 and 15 making no sense (but allowed) since they are the same as "never" & "always"
## inside the clock menu you can choose between "always", "never" and "some". The value you give inside here, is
## the value of "some". Each part of beeps has a special number and you have to add them to get the beep-some-level
## CONFIG = 1 Takeback, GameEnd, NewGame, ComputerMove and SetPieces
## BUTTON = 2 All Events coming from button press
## MAP = 4    All Events coming from Queen placing at start pos (line3-6)
## OKAY = 8   All Events from "ok" (confirm) messages
## For example to beep on "ok messages" and "button press" beep-some-level is: 8(okay) + 2(button) = 10
# beep-some-level = 3
## Specify the serial port your dgt-board is connected to.
## If you dont give a parameter picochess tries to find the board automatically (prefered usage).
# dgt-port = /dev/ttyACM0
## Instead of connecting to a dgt board, you can also start picochess with a command line.
## If so, please uncomment the next line
enable-console = True
### Handle with care! Only activate this if you have a DGT Pi clock connected. So be careful!
### Also if you activate it but have non-DGT hardware connected (@raspberryPi) you might harm your hardware.
## If you have a new DGT Pi clock please uncomment the next line.
# dgtpi = True
### You can reduce the dgtboard piece recognition by a factor from 0 to 9. Please only use this, if you suffer from
### sliding problems (like multi voices during you slide your pieces for example moving Bf1-b5 hear Be2,d3,c4 then b5).
# slow-slide = 0

### ========================
### = Chess engine options =
### ========================
### Options for the UCI-Chess engine
## Sets the UCI engine used at startup
## handle with care. If you setup this section wrong, picochess won't start.
## Path to the engine relative to the 'picochess' folder (local engine - standard case)
# engine = engines/armv7l/a-stockf
## What level the engine should have at startup?
## For a (correct) value please take a look at 'engines/<your_plattform>/<engine_name>.uci'
# engine-level = Level@20
### =========================
### = Remote engine options =
### =========================
## Path to the remote engine - good chances you do not need them ;-)
## Please make sure that you also set 'engine-remote-home' accordingly
# engine-remote = engines/armv7l/a-stockf
### Parameters for a remote engine (server)
## Where is the server with the engine
# engine-remote-server = engine.remote-domain.com
## What user to use for connect to the remote-engine server
# engine-remote-user = user@remote-domain.com
## What password for the remote-engine-server
# engine-remote-pass = your_secret_password
## The secret server-key for the remote-engine-server
# engine-remote-key = your_secret_key
## The home path (where the engines live) for the remote-engine-server
# engine-remote-home = /opt/picochess

### ==========================
### = Opening book selection =
### ==========================
### Sets the opening book used at startup
## Path of an opening book relative to the 'picochess' folder
## Defaults to book 'h', normally 'h-varied.bin', if not set or not available
# book = books/h-varied.bin

### ==================
### = Time selection =
### ==================
### Sets the startup time. If you give something like "5 0" that means 5mins blitz (default value)
## Fischer time can be set by changing this "0" (increment value) to a positive number like "3 2"
## Fixed time can be set by just giving one number like "10" meaning 10 secs/move
## You can also give non-standard values (like "4 6"), but then you cant change them inside the (time) menu.
# time = 5 0

### ================
### = Mail Service =
### ================
### Options for sending the finished game via email service
### PicoChess currently implements two different ways to send a finished game via email.
### standard SMTP email or Mailgun Webservice
### Mail general
### if email is not set, PicoChess won't attempt to send the game at all
## email tells PicoChess to which email address the game should be send to, it should be your email address :-)
# email = your.mailbox@your-domain.com 
### =======================================
### = Section for email delivery via SMTP =
### =======================================
### if smtp_server is not set, PicoChess won't attempt to send the game via SMTP
## smtp-server must contain the address of your smtp server (e.g. smtp.gmail.com)
# smtp-server = smtp.your-mailserver.com
## smtp-user is necessary if your smtp server requires authentication, sets your username
# smtp-user = your_username
## smtp-pass is necessary if your smtp server requires authentication, sets your password
# smtp-pass = your_secret_password
## Should PicoChess SSL-encrypt the communication with your smtp server (Port 465)?
## Otherwise PicoChess will use the default and unencrypted SMTP Port 21.
## Some SMTP Server require an SSL encryption (e.g. GMAIL). If so, uncomment the next line.
# smtp-encryption = True
## In case the SMTP Server thinks you are spamming, you must enter a valid from email here
# smtp-from = no-reply@picochess.org
### ==========================================
### = Section for email delivery via Mailgun =
### ==========================================
### if mailgun-key is not set, PicoChess won't attempt to send the game via Mailgun
## mailgun-key stores your Mailgun access key for Mailgun Webservice
# mailgun-key = your Mailgun API access key
