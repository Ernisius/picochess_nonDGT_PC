This folder is for tablebase files. Right now the 3+4 stone endgames for the syzygy format can be found here. Please notice,
that these files are not used out of the box for picochess or its engines. To make use of them you have to set the uci parameters
of each engine.


If you have problems please don't hassitate to contact me over eMail or skype.
